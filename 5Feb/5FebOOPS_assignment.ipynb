    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Hiding the implementation details and exposing only the necessary information to the user. This helps in creating a clear separation between the code and the user and enables the user to focus on the functionality rather than the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Wrapping data and functions within an object, making it self-contained and protected from outside access or modification. This promotes modularity and improves the security and reliability of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Allowing classes to inherit attributes and behaviors from a parent class, enabling code reuse and reducing the need for repetitive code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: The ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common class. This allows for the creation of generic functions that can be used with objects of multiple classes, making the code more flexible and adaptable.\n",
    "\n",
