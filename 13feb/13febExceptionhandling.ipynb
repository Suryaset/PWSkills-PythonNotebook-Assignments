    "Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Be specific: Catch only the exceptions you can handle and leave the rest for the caller to handle. Catching a generic exception like Exception is usually not recommended as it can mask other errors and make debugging more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep it short: Place only the code that might raise an exception inside the try block. Don't put long, complex code blocks inside try blocks, as this can make the code harder to read and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid using bare except clauses: Instead of catching all exceptions with a bare except: clause, use specific exceptions or catch only the exceptions that you expect to occur. This makes your code more readable and helps to ensure that you handle the expected exceptions properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use finally: Use the finally block to clean up resources like files or network connections that were opened inside the try block, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log errors: Log exceptions instead of printing them to the console. This helps in debugging and maintaining the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use context managers: Use context managers like with statement to automatically clean up resources and avoid errors caused by forgetting to close resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document exceptions: Document which exceptions a function may raise and what they mean in the function's docstring. This makes it easier for other developers to use and maintain your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use custom exceptions: Create custom exception classes to better handle specific types of errors that might occur in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these best practices, you can write more robust and maintainable code that is easier to debug and less prone to errors."
