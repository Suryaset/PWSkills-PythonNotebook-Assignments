    "Multithreading is a technique used in programming to allow multiple threads of execution to run concurrently within a single process. In Python, a thread is a separate flow of execution within a program that can run independently of other threads, allowing multiple parts of the program to run simultaneously.\n",

It includes classes for creating and controlling threads, as well as functions for working with locks, semaphores, and other thread synchronization primitives."

Race conditions occur when two or more threads access shared resources in an unpredictable order, resulting in non-deterministic behavior.
