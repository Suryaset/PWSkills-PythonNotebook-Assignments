    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception is raised, Python stops executing the program at the point where the exception occurred and looks for a \"handler\" to deal with the exception. If a handler is found, it takes appropriate action to recover from the exception and continue execution of the program. If no handler is found, the program terminates and an error message is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions in Python can be raised explicitly by the raise statement or they can be raised implicitly by errors in the code such as division by zero, trying to access an undefined variable, or trying to perform an unsupported operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are errors that occur when the Python interpreter cannot understand or interpret a program because of incorrect syntax. Syntax errors are caught by the Python interpreter before the program is executed, and they prevent the program from running at all. Common examples of syntax errors include misspelling a keyword, leaving out a colon, or using incorrect indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between an exception and a syntax error is that exceptions occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors occur before the program is executed. Exceptions can be handled and recovered from, while syntax errors must be fixed before the program can run at all."
