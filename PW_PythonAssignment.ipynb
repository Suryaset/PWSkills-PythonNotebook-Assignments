    "# Ans 1  Charesteristics of Tuples in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordered\n",
    "When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unchangeable\n",
    "Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Allow Duplicates\n",
    "Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are immutable and hence cannot have any changes in them once they are created in Python. This is because they support the same sequence operations as strings."

    "# Ans 2 The built-in methods for Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "The two built-in tuple methods in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**count -** returns the number of occurrences of a specific element in the tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "t = (1, 2, 3, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(t.count(2)) \n",
    "\n",
    "#Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**index -** returns the index of the first occurrence of a specific element in the tuple\n",

    "\n",
    "Tuples have only two built-in methods as compared to lists because tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be modified. This is in contrast to lists, which are mutable and therefore have more built-in methods for modifying their contents. The count and index methods are sufficient for retrieving information from a tuple, but other methods for modifying tuples are not needed because tuples cannot be modified."
