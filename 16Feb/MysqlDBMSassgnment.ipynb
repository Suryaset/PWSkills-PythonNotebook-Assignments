    "A database is a structured collection of data that can be stored, organized, and accessed in various ways. Databases are used to store and manage large amounts of data, from simple lists of information to complex systems that support a variety of applications and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of databases, each with their own unique characteristics and strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that use Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage data. They are based on the relational data model, where data is organized into tables with rows and columns, and each row represents a record with a unique key. SQL databases are known for their strong consistency, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties, and well-defined schemas. Popular SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that do not use SQL to manage data. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as documents, graph data, and key-value pairs. NoSQL databases are known for their flexibility, scalability, and ability to handle complex and dynamic data models. They also typically offer weaker consistency models than SQL databases, but they can be designed to provide eventual consistency. Popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases are good for applications that require strong consistency, well-defined schemas, and transactions. NoSQL databases are good for applications that require scalability, flexibility, and support for unstructured data. The choice of database ultimately depends on the specific requirements of the application and the type of data being stored and accessed."

It is used to ensure data integrity and consistency, as it ensures that each row in a table can be uniquely identified and accessed. A primary key is always unique and cannot have null values.\n",

    "A foreign key, on the other hand, is a column or a combination of columns that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to establish a relationship between two tables, allowing data to be shared between them.
